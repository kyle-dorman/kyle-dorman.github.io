Day 5 / Day 20. Week one of Fullstack is almost over. Yesterday was a really fun day. We used pair programming for the first time. ALthough my ruby skills are probably better then most of the people here, I still found lots for benifits from paired programming. When I wasn't on the keyboard I had to vocalize what I thought we should do instead of typing it. This slowed my thiking process now and gave me a chance to catch some of my mistakes. It also made me explain why I thought we should do one method vs. another and vocalize what information we ahd and what we wanted to do with it. I also think that my typing is not amazing yet so not being on the computer let me continue to think instead of stopping and starting while I typed. Which is what I'm doing now lol.

The API part was awesome. Defintely my first time really using an API and having some semblance of an idea why we took the steps we took. I'd like to read over and API at sound point to understand what is really going on behind the scenes. I understand taking the API as is and not asking too many questions is generally benificial but on an general level I'd like to understand what happens when we install a gem and then require the gem and then call the API class and its methods.

The day we did the Learn Ruby stuff felt slow to me. Apparently I had already done most of this stuff to prepare for the AppAcademy code interview, but I didn't realize it until I had gone through all the exercises. I did enjoy the Haiku stuff. I like those type of mind games. I think having some extra extra challenges would have been good. Then could have kept playing with my code more.

Yesterday I started writing a Sudoku solver. This was promted by Julian deciding to write a sudoku generator. I was thinking it through last night as I was falling asleep and I can definitly see pieces or groups that I am modeling and feel like using classes could benificial (right now I am using a complex array to keep track of everything) but still don't completly understand how to relate classes to each otehr and call each other's methods and all that jazz. *side note, that gsub! problem really shook my ruby confidence yesterday and now I keep doubting if I truly understand what I am updating. WHich is a good thing, but I definitly have questions and may be creating too many variables or may not be creating enough.

I am excited to get into javascript. Even after doing the prep courses on javascript I still only have a basic understanding of it but realize how powerful it is and how much fun I could be having with it. It sort of feels like ruby logic but with very visual and wuick results.

Ok thats all I got

Cheers,
Kyle
