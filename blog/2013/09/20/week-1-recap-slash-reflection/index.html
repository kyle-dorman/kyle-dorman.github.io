<p>Day 5 / Day 20. Week one of Fullstack is almost over. Yesterday was a really fun day. We used pair programming for the first time. ALthough my ruby skills are probably better then most of the people here, I still found lots for benifits from paired programming. When I wasn&rsquo;t on the keyboard I had to vocalize what I thought we should do instead of typing it. This slowed my thiking process now and gave me a chance to catch some of my mistakes. It also made me explain why I thought we should do one method vs. another and vocalize what information we ahd and what we wanted to do with it. I also think that my typing is not amazing yet so not being on the computer let me continue to think instead of stopping and starting while I typed. Which is what I&rsquo;m doing now lol.</p>

<p>The API part was awesome. Defintely my first time really using an API and having some semblance of an idea why we took the steps we took. I&rsquo;d like to read over and API at sound point to understand what is really going on behind the scenes. I understand taking the API as is and not asking too many questions is generally benificial but on an general level I&rsquo;d like to understand what happens when we install a gem and then require the gem and then call the API class and its methods.</p>

<p>The day we did the Learn Ruby stuff felt slow to me. Apparently I had already done most of this stuff to prepare for the AppAcademy code interview, but I didn&rsquo;t realize it until I had gone through all the exercises. I did enjoy the Haiku stuff. I like those type of mind games. I think having some extra extra challenges would have been good. Then could have kept playing with my code more.</p>

<p>Yesterday I started writing a Sudoku solver. This was promted by Julian deciding to write a sudoku generator. I was thinking it through last night as I was falling asleep and I can definitly see pieces or groups that I am modeling and feel like using classes could benificial (right now I am using a complex array to keep track of everything) but still don&rsquo;t completly understand how to relate classes to each otehr and call each other&rsquo;s methods and all that jazz. *side note, that gsub! problem really shook my ruby confidence yesterday and now I keep doubting if I truly understand what I am updating. WHich is a good thing, but I definitly have questions and may be creating too many variables or may not be creating enough.</p>

<p>I am excited to get into javascript. Even after doing the prep courses on javascript I still only have a basic understanding of it but realize how powerful it is and how much fun I could be having with it. It sort of feels like ruby logic but with very visual and wuick results.</p>

<p>Ok thats all I got</p>

<p>Cheers,
Kyle</p>

<p>P.S. please forgive any spelling mistakes</p>
